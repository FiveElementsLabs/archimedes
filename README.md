<h1 align="center">Archimedes</h1>

> Archimedes is an ETH Amsterdam hackaton project made by [Five Elements Labs](https://fiveelementslabs.com/)

**üèÜ Update: Archimedes won the 1st prize for Gearbox Protocol, 1st prize for Yearn Finance and 1st prize for Tribe DAO.**

## The idea

We built a distribution layer for tokenized DeFi hedged strategies using
Gearbox protocol and the new ERC-4626 vault standard.

In short, with Archimedes users can invest in complex levered strategies with a single click
in a totally permissionless way and enjoy benefits such as liquidation protection and simple analytics.
